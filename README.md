<h1>css and js Exercise</h1>
<p>hoverable sideNav is basically a small exercise with colorful buttons which I liked the design and wanted to give it a try and write it myself!</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>at first my strategy was to move the buttons with (left/top) but eventually I moved them with translate.</p>
<p>Also I tried to use % instead of giving pixels for the size of my containers as possible.</p>
